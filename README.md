# Valentine’s Day Confession Website 💌

This is a fun, heartfelt website I created to ask someone out on Valentine’s Day.  
Simple, sweet, and personal — just like the message it carries.

## 💡 What's Inside
- A cute, themed landing page with Valentine visuals
- Personal message crafted with care and (some courage 😅)
- A final reveal/ask page with a YES/NO prompt
- A twist ( the responder can only say yes )

## ❤️ Purpose
To make someone smile and hopefully say yes — because code can carry feelings too.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript for interactions

## 📝 Notes
- All content is original and handcrafted
- Can be reused as a love letter template with some edits

*Love, like code, is better when you write it yourself.* 💖
